Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

During this subject, I have started to allocate specific time slots for coding practice each week, rather than trying to do everything at the last minute. This has helped me manage my workload better and reduce stress.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?

I need to improve my time management further by breaking down larger tasks into smaller, more manageable steps. I also need to stop procrastinating when faced with difficult problems and instead tackle them one step at a time.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I am doing well in terms of participating in discussions and seeking help when needed. I have also been consistent in completing practical exercises, which helps reinforce my understanding of the concepts.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I need to stop getting discouraged when I encounter errors in my code. Instead, I should view these errors as opportunities to learn and improve. I also need to change my habit of skipping detailed documentation and instead take the time to understand the material more thoroughly.



## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?
