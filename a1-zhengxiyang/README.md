# CP1404 Assignment 1 - Travel Tracker

Assignment 1 for CP1404/CP5632, IT@JCU

By: **Yang Zhengxi**

This repo contains starter files including a Python file and two CSV files.

- `places.csv` a data file for you to use.
- `places_backup.csv` is the same data, but not to be used in your program... it is here as a backup to copy the data
  from if you need it again.

**Edit this README file**, replacing this paragraph with your own assignment name and details.  
At the end of the project, complete the very brief project reflection below by answering the questions (replace
the `answer...` parts).

1. How long did the entire assignment 1 project take you?

> I spent approximately 10 hours on this assignment, including planning, coding, and testing.

2. What do you plan to do differently in your development process for assignment 2?

> For assignment 2, I plan to create a more structured approach by using version control more effectively and breaking down the tasks into smaller, more manageable parts. I will also focus on writing unit tests to ensure the reliability of the code.
