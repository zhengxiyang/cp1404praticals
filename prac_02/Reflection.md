# Reflection

## 1. What do you think are the most important concepts covered so far in this subject?

- **Functions:** Learning to break programs into reusable, clear, and well-named functions is crucial. It makes code easier to read, maintain, and debug.
- **Version control with Git and GitHub:** Understanding how to track changes, commit updates, and push to GitHub helps ensure my work is always backed up and available across different computers.
- **Refactoring:** Refactoring older code to use functions emphasizes writing cleaner, more modular code.

## 2. What have you found the easiest to understand so far, and why?

- **Writing simple functions:** Breaking up code into smaller, focused functions has been relatively easy because each function has a clear, single purpose. Using Python’s syntax for functions also feels natural after some practice.
- **Basic Git operations:** Commands like `git add`, `git commit`, and `git push` are easy to understand, and PyCharm’s Git integration makes the process even simpler.

## 3. What have you found the most challenging, and why?

- **Setting up GitHub and understanding branches:** While Git basics are clear, setting up GitHub, understanding branching, and working with pull requests were a bit confusing initially because they involve multiple steps and new terminology.
- **Debugging functions with PyCharm:** Although functions themselves are easy to write, sometimes isolating issues when debugging within PyCharm has been challenging, especially when errors occur across multiple functions.

## 4. How do you think the practicals are helping with your understanding?

- **Hands-on practice:** The practicals provide direct, hands-on experience, which reinforces the concepts taught in lectures. Writing and refactoring code help solidify function usage and principles like the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- **Immediate feedback through version control:** Using Git/GitHub allows me to keep track of changes, and if something goes wrong, I can easily revert to previous versions of my code. This makes me feel more confident to experiment and try new things in my code.

## 5. What changes (if any) would you like to see in how the subject is being taught?

- **More examples of complex Git workflows:** It would be helpful to see more examples of how branching, pull requests, and collaboration work in larger projects. Right now, we're using Git mostly for simple commits, but learning how to handle conflicts and more complex Git tasks would be beneficial.
- **More debugging tips:** I’d like to learn more tips on debugging and solving common issues in Python, especially for larger programs that involve multiple functions.

## 6. Any other feedback or thoughts?

- **Pacing is good:** The balance between lectures and practicals feels just right so far. There is enough time to practice and apply what we’ve learned.
- **Enjoying the hands-on nature:** I appreciate how practical the subject is, especially with real-world tools like Git and GitHub, which I know will be useful in my future projects and career.
