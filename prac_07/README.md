# CP1404 Practicals Repository

## Overview

This repository contains the practical work for CP1404: Programming II. It is designed to help develop skills in Python programming, focusing on clean code, object-oriented principles, and good software practices.

### About the Author
I am a student at James Cook University, currently learning about Python programming and software development. These practicals are part of my journey in learning to create clean, effective, and maintainable code.

## Lessons Learned About Clean Code
- **Meaningful Naming**: I have learned the importance of using clear, descriptive variable names, which makes code more readable and understandable.
- **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each function or class should have one responsibility, which makes it easier to test, maintain, and extend.
- **Consistent Formatting**: Consistent code formatting helps in understanding the flow and reduces errors. I always ensure to reformat the code before committing.
