# CP1404 Practical Repository

## Introduction
Welcome to my CP1404 Practical Repository! This repository contains all my work and exercises completed during the CP1404 course at James Cook University (JCU). It showcases my journey in learning Python programming, focusing on various aspects like clean code practices, file handling, data manipulation, and object-oriented programming.

## About the Author
I am Yang Zhengxi, a dedicated and passionate student at James Cook University. My interests lie in software development, data science, and creating efficient, readable, and reusable code. Feel free to reach out to me at [zhengxi.yang@my.jcu.edu.au](mailto:zhengxi.yang@my.jcu.edu.au).

## Lessons Learned about Clean Code
Through this course, I have learned several key lessons about writing clean and efficient code:

- **Readability Matters**: Writing code that is easy to read and understand is crucial. This involves proper naming conventions, consistent indentation, and clear documentation.
- **DRY Principle**: "Don't Repeat Yourself." I've learned to avoid redundancy by using functions and classes effectively, which makes the code more maintainable.
- **Error Handling and Testing**: Ensuring the robustness of code through proper error handling and writing comprehensive tests.
- **Code Refactoring**: The importance of regularly revisiting and improving existing code to make it more efficient and readable.
